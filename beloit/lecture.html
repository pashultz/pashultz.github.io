<h2>What do <i>Guitar Hero</i> and <i>Rock Band</i> force us to rethink?</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What counts as musical activity

<h2>What counts as musical activity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
It might take a culture-wide reassessment of human musicality to vouchsafe wide agreement that what players do with music in these games should even count as “musical.”

<h3>Four defenses offered by players</h3>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They’re just games. No one actually thinks they’re playing music.
</li>
<li>They offer musical experiences to unmusical people.
</li>
<li>They can be a stepping stone to real music.
</li>
<li>They improve listening skills and cultivate respect for musicians.
</li>

<h3>Closing the gap between virtual and visceral</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
In response, many players are closing the gap between virtual and visceral performance not only by achieving a note-by-note correspondence between physical input and audible output, but by performing like rock stars: They engage physically with their musical performances in ways that go far beyond what is required to provide accurate inputs to the game software.

<h2>Rock authenticity</h2>
</section>
<section id="sec-3-1" >

<h3><i>Rock Band</i> and reality.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Shooting another character in a video game doesn’t put a real bleeding corpse in your living room, but pressing buttons or hitting drum pads on game-controller instruments brings forth real music. This “realness” is grounded in a shared cultural assumption that music consists first and foremost of sound, so recorded music is not considered to be “fake” music (although live musical performance retains special status, and faked live performance therefore evokes special scorn).
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Originality and spontaneity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is a fundamental mismatch between these games’ musical-production mechanics and their guiding musical aesthetic. Rock musicians don’t perform from notation, and the guitar hero in particular is “a representative icon of individual creative expression” whose musical-genius status relies on apparent originality and spontaneity (Waksman 2001:124).

<h3>Pleasure of performance</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
In assessing a song, players ask themselves whether it is satisfying to play, rather than whether it sounds good or is consistent with their ideas about their own tastes.

<h3>Subjunctivity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
The subjunctivity of mimicry sidesteps the oft-rehearsed arguments over whether plastic guitars are “real” or “fake”: to insist on the distinction in a ludic context is as meaningless as it would be to argue over the toxicological effects of the “poison” taken by Leonora in a production of <i>Il Trovatore</i>.

<h2>Music and/as play</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
In both cases players have to master a particular technical interface—a game controller or an instrument—in order to realize specific, time-sensitive visual interactions in an environment that provides multisensory feedback.

<h3>cont&rsquo;d</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Both practices rely on “[the] corporealization of perception, the translation of perception into bodily movement” (Lahti 2003: 164). And in both […], in order to play well, one must practice certain activities until they are internalized and don’t require conscious attention.

<h3>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Inside all the brilliance, however, still lurks that stupidity: it’s a game about jumping that you control with a fake musical instrument. This is not a sensible idea. Music is about performance. It’s about gradually evolving a mastery over a complex instrument. It’s practicing until you’re good enough to get past the hard bits. 
</p>

<h4>cont&rsquo;d</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s about taking some inert dots on paper - some crazy kind of code - and turning it into a living, breathing experience that’s always the same and yet always different. It’s about the sense of power and virtuosity produced when you finish a section with a flourish. Games, on the other hand, are&#x2026;

<h3>Raw musical skill doesn&rsquo;t translate to games</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
As the ball traces through the sequence at a perfectly constant speed, any attempt to make a melody of this course of movements, to grasp it as a human gesture, comes up against an insistent mathematical irregularity where melodies can&rsquo;t exist.

<h4>cont&rsquo;d</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
From each shot to the next I must latch on to the ball anew to give my hand a next time of arrival completely independent of what happened before, so the attempt to establish an unfolding rhythm to link up one shot to the next is forever undermined and altogether pointless.

<h3>Johan Huizinga, 42</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is quite natural that we should tend to conceive music as lying within the sphere of play, even apart from these special linguistic instances. Making music bears at the outset all the formal characteristics of play proper: the activity begins and ends within strict limits of time and place, is repeatable, 
</p>

<h4>Huizinga 42, cont&rsquo;d</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
consists essentially in order, rhythm, alternation, transports audience and performers alike out of ‘ordinary’ life into a sphere of gladness and serenity, which makes even sad music a lofty pleasure.
</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="sec-4-4-2" >

<h4>Huizinga 42, cont&rsquo;d</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
[…] Further, bearing in mind that the term ‘playing’ is never applied to singing, and to music-making only in certain languages, it seems probable that the connecting link between play and instrumental skill is to be sought in the nimble and orderly movements of the fingers.

<h3>Ludomusicology</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Whereas Laroche’s deployment of the term has reflected a primary interest in music within games, I am more concerned with the extent to which music might be understood as a game: as I see it, ludomusicology involves the study of both the musically playful and the playfully musical.

<h4>Moseley 6&#x2013;7, cont&rsquo;d</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bringing music and play into contact in this way offers access to the undocumented means by which composers, designers, programmers, performers, players, and audiences interact with music, games, and one another. It promises to account for competitive behavior, the acceptance and evasion of protocols and constraints, the pleasures of rhythmic bodies in motion, and the dizzy delight taken in exhibitions of virtuosity.

<h2>A few questions</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why do Miller and Moseley pay so little attention to voice, compared to instruments?
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What does <i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i> say about the Beatles? 
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can we blame the decline and fall of <i>Rock Band</i> and Harmonix on a slump in guitar rock? What about <i>DJ Hero</i>?
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why don&rsquo;t sports games irk people like this? (See Miller 151)
