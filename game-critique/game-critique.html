<h2>Why games? Why critique?</h2>
<p>
Games are an expressive medium.
</p>

<p>
They reflect and promote ideology.

<h4>Victory is your destiny</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is essential to <i>FSW</i> that time can be reversed, and every mistake
undone; the ‘save-die-restart’ sequence makes Alpha and Bravo
immortal. This is, of course, the big lie of war-as-video-game.

<p>
The game is perfectly aware that it’s incentivizing killing. It wants to. It’s aware that the “moral choice” moments it gives you amount to nothing. […]
Unlike most shooters, Spec Ops: The Line wonders what kind of person likes virtual killing enough to spend hours engaged in it. It bothers to ask, “Aren’t we all a little sick and crazy to want this?”

<h4>The politics of <i>SimCity</i>, according to its developers</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
So that the core agenda that I&rsquo;ve got with this is to make a
simulation that is a landscape that the player can explore,
metaphorical landscape—you push on it and see what it happens. It&rsquo;s
absolutely not to make an ideologically channeled experience where you
have to get all pious and make the right environmental choices to win
because that would be, frankly, absurd, as a gameplay experience. That
becomes an exercise in propaganda, as opposed to giving you a
simulation to explore.

<h4>The politics of <i>SimCity</i>, according to a political scientist</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>
[…] there are problems in both versions of the inherent simulation […]
Of these, I wish to focus on three: <i>SimCity</i>&rsquo;s exaggeration of the
role of state planning in urban development; its neglect of one of the
most salient features of American urban life&#x2014;race; and its
underestimation of the social&#x2014;as opposed to the
material&#x2014;dimensions of city life.

<h3>Clear-headed judgment</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Soldiers should always obey orders and regulations,” the colonel says […] “However,” he continues, […] “you must always use your clear-headed judgment (shikul-da’at). One can never know what they’ll try next. Orders and regulations are sacred but they cannot cover all possible scenarios. You must use your judgment to decide in any given case if it is an exception to the rule. There’s nothing as valuable as a soldier’s clear-headed judgment.”

<h4>The soldier and the child</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
When the child discovers the checkpoint is closed and he cannot get home, he begins to cry. Recalling the freedom and responsibility to exercise his clear-headed judgment, the soldier decides to let the child through. A while later, ten crying children come by. They all heard about a new way to pass through the checkpoint even when it is officially closed.

<h4>The soldier and the child</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
At this point, facing the crying children, the soldier realizes he made a mistake—not because these children are dangerous, but because he cannot afford to be fooled by ten-year-olds, or by anyone, for that matter. There cannot be an efficient way to pass through his checkpoint. Any such way may be used against him, against his mission.

<h3>Let&rsquo;s hear from the marginalized</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Many of these games will be mediocre, of course; the majority of work
in any form is mediocre. But we’ll see many more interesting ideas
just by the sheer mathematical virtue of so many people producing
games without the commercial obligations industry games are beholden
to. […] And even if a game isn’t original, it’s personal, in the way a
game designed to appeal to target demographics can’t be. And that’s a
cultural artifact our world is a little bit richer for having.
