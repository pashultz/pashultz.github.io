* Why games? Why critique?

Games are an expressive medium.

They reflect and promote ideology.

* Playing war

It is essential to /FSW/ that time can be reversed, and every mistake
undone; the ‘save-die-restart’ sequence makes Alpha and Bravo
immortal. This is, of course, the big lie of war-as-video-game.

The game is perfectly aware that it’s incentivizing killing. It wants to. It’s aware that the “moral choice” moments it gives you amount to nothing. […]
Unlike most shooters, Spec Ops: The Line wonders what kind of person likes virtual killing enough to spend hours engaged in it. It bothers to ask, “Aren’t we all a little sick and crazy to want this?”

procedural systems like computer software actually represent process

for this klik of the month, it had been suggested that we all use animated gifs from this internet treasure trove. i knew that i wanted to make a game about police violence at the occupy protests, so i searched through their police category until i found the above masterpiece. the rest came out of that.

* Disagreeing with games

** Ideology and realism

*** The politics of /SimCity/, according to its developers
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./img/ocean-quigley-dark.jpg
:END:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
So that the core agenda that I've got with this is to make a
simulation that is a landscape that the player can explore,
metaphorical landscape—you push on it and see what it happens. It's
absolutely not to make an ideologically channeled experience where you
have to get all pious and make the right environmental choices to win
because that would be, frankly, absurd, as a gameplay experience. That
becomes an exercise in propaganda, as opposed to giving you a
simulation to explore.

*** The politics of /SimCity/, according to a political scientist
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./img/kenneth-kolson-big-plans.jpg
:END:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[…] there are problems in both versions of the inherent simulation […]
Of these, I wish to focus on three: /SimCity/'s exaggeration of the
role of state planning in urban development; its neglect of one of the
most salient features of American urban life---race; and its
underestimation of the social---as opposed to the
material---dimensions of city life.

*** What grounds this critique?
- In other words, why would any of this be a problem?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Is it a problem?

* Interlude: design a game in three minutes

** Vegetarianism /  

* old slides

** Critique or glorification?

Can a game be too much fun?

*** Prison Architect
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./img/prison-architect.jpg
:END:

“We have a chapter where a politician decides that he would like to
run an experiment. He says to you that you should try and create a
full reform prison where budget is no object. Assuming money was no
factor, how much could you actually do with a reform prison? […]

“And then when people come to play the sandbox, we’re hoping that we
will have seeded their mind a little bit with some of the moral issues
behind each of the decisions they might make. We’ll let the player
build an execution chamber in the sandbox, and I’ve no doubt that
people are going to build vast execution prisons, but I don’t really
have a problem with that.”

*** Cow Clicker
#+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="stretch" src="img/cow-clicker.jpg" />

** The limits of system-based critique
- To what extent is the meaning of the rules shaped by aesthetic
  presentation?
- Can game mechanics carry a message in themselves?

** Disruptive game mechanics

“Mechanics are politics. We’ve been playing straight games.”

—Joli St. Patrick and Joe Mcdaldno, “Beyond Representation: Queer Mechanics in Tabletop Games”

** Disruptive game mechanics

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- The Fruitful Void: Your game is about whatever it is conspicuously missing.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Character non-monogamy: You don’t own the character exclusively.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Enshrining the preposterous: Games don’t need to be physics engines

** 10-minute game design challenge

- work in groups of three or four
- left: immigration, right: healthcare/insurance
- whom/what does the player control?
- what systems do they interact with?
- what do they learn or understand through playing the game?

** Part II: Inhabiting roles

*** Gender in games
- Mainstream games have not done well representing women
- Anita Sarkeesian (Feminist Frequency) on the “Damsel in Distress” trope
#+REVEAL_HTML: <img class="stretch" src="img/anita-sarkeesian.jpg" />

*** Gender in games
- Anna Anthropy: “The problem with videogames is that they’re created by a small,
  insular group of people.”

*** Anna Anthropy: We need different people making games

“Many of these games will be mediocre, of course; the majority of work
in any form is mediocre. But we’ll see many more interesting ideas
just by the sheer mathematical virtue of so many people producing
games without the commercial obligations industry games are beholden
to. […] And even if a game isn’t original, it’s personal, in the way a
game designed to appeal to target demographics can’t be. And that’s a
cultural artifact our world is a little bit richer for having.”

*** Game design challenge, round 2

This time, focus on persuasion through role

- work in groups of three or four
- left: healthcare/insurance, right: immigration
- whom/what does the player control?
- what systems do they interact with?
- what do they learn or understand through playing the game?

** Part III: Telling stories

* examples -- can't use 'em all

- What changes over the course of the game?
- What do its systems convey?
- What about the player’s role?
- What would be different if it were set in a made-up America rather
  than a made-up Eastern Bloc country?

“The rules of the game are learned by living in its world, leading to
many sad tales of cart vendors who bought the wrong ingredients,
mothers that lost custody of their child, and immigrants so overworked
that they forgot to feed their cat for days. Cart Life suggests these
things happen in life more than we care to acknowledge.”

“I’ve spent many days making change with a cash register, bucking hay
bales, collating documents, book binding, editing video, screen
printing, transcribing audio, taping boxes, stacking huge piles of
newspapers, washing dishes. I’ve had a lot of these jobs where they
seem impossibly nuanced for the first day or two, but you just pick it
up. Isn’t that funny? How we’re all so work-averse, but we can do
anything with enough practice.”
