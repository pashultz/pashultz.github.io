* Games as Critique

Just like any other medium, games reflect and promote ideology.

** But games are special
- they let us play with systems
- they let us inhabit roles

*** They do other things too!
- they tell stories
- they entertain us
- they bore us
- they frustrate us
- etc.

*** But we’ll focus on those two
- playing with systems
- inhabiting roles

* Part I: Representing systems

“Even though other inscription techniques may be partly or wholly
driven by a desire to represent human or material processes, only
procedural systems like computer software actually represent process
with process.” —Ian Bogost

** Oil God
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./img/oil-god.jpg
:END:

** Oil God

“To me the game was just wrong because it was basically supporting the
theory of artificial scarcity: since the oil companies tend to
increase their profits after disasters and turmoils, there is a sort
of disembodied will, connected to the oil industry that is actually
causing these turmoils and disasters. I think that statement is
partially true but above all it absolutely misleading if you want to
explain the rise in oil prices.”

—Paolo Pedercini (aka Molleindustria)

** Oiligarchy

** The Rhetoric of Failure

“Such games present a scenario that can't be won under the rules
provided. These games make a statement about those rules, arguing that
they are insufficient for the task to which they are currently being
put.”

—Ian Bogost

** Full Spectrum Warrior

“FSW [Full Spectrum Warrior]’s double life as actual trainer and
virtual toy, we argue, aptly demonstrates the ‘banalization of war’
(Hardt and Negri 2000, 12)—the enveloping sociocultural-emotional
process habituating populations to the perpetual conflict of the war
on terror.”

—Dyer-Witheford & de Peuter, p. 99

** ”The big lie of war-as-video-game”

“It is essential to FSW that time can be reversed, and every mistake
undone; the ‘save-die-restart’ sequence makes Alpha and Bravo
immortal. This is, of course, the big lie of war-as-video-game.

“There are other subsidiary lies in FSW’s virtual war. […] It is war
without mutilation or post-traumatic stress disorder. It is also war
without moral dilemmas. And there are almost no civilians.
The miracle of Zekistan is that its streets are deserted and houses
empty, apart from the ubiquitous Tangos (who all die instantaneously
when hit). Air and artillery strikes do not hit wedding parties. There
is no collateral damage. War is peace.”

Dyer-Witheford & de Peuter, pp. 112–113

** The message of commercial war games

“War is horrible /and/ badass”

—Ian Bogost

“Saving even a single soul—climbing out of the trench, grabbing a
fallen body and lugging it back to safety under a senseless hail of
bullets—is incredibly difficult.” —Anna Anthropy

** /Spec Ops: The Line/

“Unlike most shooters, Spec Ops: The Line wonders what kind of person
likes virtual killing enough to spend hours engaged in it. It bothers
to ask, ‘Aren't we all a little sick and crazy to want this?’” —Tom Bissell

** Critique or glorification?

Can a game be too much fun?

*** Prison Architect
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./img/prison-architect.jpg
:END:

“We have a chapter where a politician decides that he would like to
run an experiment. He says to you that you should try and create a
full reform prison where budget is no object. Assuming money was no
factor, how much could you actually do with a reform prison? […]

“And then when people come to play the sandbox, we’re hoping that we
will have seeded their mind a little bit with some of the moral issues
behind each of the decisions they might make. We’ll let the player
build an execution chamber in the sandbox, and I’ve no doubt that
people are going to build vast execution prisons, but I don’t really
have a problem with that.”

Chris Delay, lead designer and programmer

** The limits of system-based critique
- To what extent is the meaning of the rules shaped by aesthetic
  presentation?
- Can game mechanics carry a message in themselves?

** SimCity and political neutrality

“So that the core agenda that I've got with this is to make a
simulation that is a landscape that the player can explore,
metaphorical landscape—you push on it and see what it happens. It's
absolutely not to make an ideologically channeled experience where you
have to get all pious and make the right environmental choices to win
because that would be, frankly, absurd, as a gameplay experience. That
becomes an exercise in propaganda, as opposed to giving you a
simulation to explore.”

—Ocean Quigley, creative director of /SimCity/ (2013)

** Disruptive game mechanics

“Mechanics are politics. We’ve been playing straight games.”

—Joli St. Patrick and Joe Mcdaldno, “Beyond Representation: Queer Mechanics in Tabletop Games”

** 10-minute game design challenge

- work in groups of three or four
- left: immigration, right: healthcare/insurance
- whom/what does the player control?
- what systems do they interact with?
- what do they learn or understand through playing the game?

* Part II: Inhabiting roles

** /Papers, Please/, by Lucas Pope

** /Papers, Please/, by Lucas Pope
- What changes over the course of the game?
- What do its systems convey?
- What about the player’s role?
- What would be different if it were set in a made-up America rather
  than a made-up Eastern Bloc country?

“The rules of the game are learned by living in its world, leading to
many sad tales of cart vendors who bought the wrong ingredients,
mothers that lost custody of their child, and immigrants so overworked
that they forgot to feed their cat for days. Cart Life suggests these
things happen in life more than we care to acknowledge.”

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
“I’ve spent many days making change with a cash register, bucking hay
bales, collating documents, book binding, editing video, screen
printing, transcribing audio, taping boxes, stacking huge piles of
newspapers, washing dishes. I’ve had a lot of these jobs where they
seem impossibly nuanced for the first day or two, but you just pick it
up. Isn’t that funny? How we’re all so work-averse, but we can do
anything with enough practice.”

** Gender in games
- Mainstream games have not done well representing women
- Anita Sarkeesian (Feminist Frequency) on the “Damsel in Distress” trope

** Gender in games
- Anna Anthropy: “The problem with videogames is that they’re created by a small,
  insular group of people.”

:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./img/dys4ia.png
:END:

** Anna Anthropy: We need different people making games

“Many of these games will be mediocre, of course; the majority of work
in any form is mediocre. But we’ll see many more interesting ideas
just by the sheer mathematical virtue of so many people producing
games without the commercial obligations industry games are beholden
to. […] And even if a game isn’t original, it’s personal, in the way a
game designed to appeal to target demographics can’t be. And that’s a
cultural artifact our world is a little bit richer for having.”

** Game design challenge, round 2

This time, focus on persuasion through role

- work in groups of three or four
- left: healthcare/insurance, right: immigration
- whom/what does the player control?
- what systems do they interact with?
- what do they learn or understand through playing the game?

- simulation
- consumer culture
- class

* The Takeaway
- Games are political speech.
- More and more people are speaking.
- You could be one of them!
